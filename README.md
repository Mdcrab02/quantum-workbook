## üåü About the Project

This repository serves as my personal laboratory for exploring quantum computing concepts, algorithms, and implementations using IBM's Qiskit framework. Through a series of interactive Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts, I document my journey through quantum mechanics fundamentals, quantum gates, circuit design, and advanced quantum algorithms. Whether you're a fellow quantum enthusiast, a student diving into quantum computing, or a researcher looking for practical implementations, this workbook provides hands-on examples and detailed explanations of quantum computing principles. The notebooks progress from basic quantum concepts to more complex algorithms, making it an excellent resource for learning and experimentation in the quantum realm.
